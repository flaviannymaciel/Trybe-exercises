/* Ex. 1 - Welcome to Flexbox Froggy, a game where you help Froggy and friends by writing CSS code! 
Guide this frog to the lilypad on the right by using the justify-content property, which aligns items 
horizontally and accepts the following values:

flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
center: Items align at the center of the container.
space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.
For example, justify-content: flex-end; will move the frog to the right. */

#pond {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-end;
}

/* Ex. 2 - Use justify-content again to help these frogs get to their lilypads. 
Remember that this CSS property aligns items horizontally and accepts the following values:
flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
center: Items align at the center of the container.
space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them. */
#pond {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

/* Ex. 3 - Help all three frogs find their lilypads just by using justify-content. 
This time, the lilypads have lots of space all around them.

If you find yourself forgetting the possible values for a property, 
you can hover over the property name to view them. Try hovering over justify-content. */
#pond {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

/* Ex. 4 - Now the lilypads on the edges have drifted to the shore, increasing the space between them. 
Use justify-content. This time, the lilypads have equal spacing between them. */
#pond {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
