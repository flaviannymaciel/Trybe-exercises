/* Your job is to stop the incoming enemies from getting past your defenses. Unlike other tower defense games, 
you must position your towers using CSS!
We'll start with container properties. A flexbox container has a main axis and a cross axis.

Use the justify-content property on the tower group container to move your towers into effective positions. 
Justify-content positions a container's items along the main axis and accepts the following values:

flex-start: group items at the start of a container's main axis
flex-end: group items at the end of the main axis
center: group items in the center of the main axis
space-between: evenly distribute items along the main axis such that the first item aligns at the start and the final item aligns at the end
space-around: evenly distribute items along the main axis such that all items have equal space around them
Try justify-content: center; for example, to move the container's towers to the center of the main axis */
/* Ex. 1 */
.tower-group-1 {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
/* Ex. 2 */
.tower-group-1 {
display: flex;
justify-content: flex-end;
}
.tower-group-2 {
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
}
.tower-group-3 {
display: flex;
justify-content: flex-end;
}
/* Ex. 3 */
.tower-group-1 {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
.tower-group-2 {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
