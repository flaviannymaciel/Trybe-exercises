/* Ex. 14 - Sometimes reversing the row or column order of a container is not enough. 
In these cases, we can apply the order property to individual items. 
By default, items have a value of 0, but we can use this property to also set it to a positive or 
negative integer value (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2).
Use the order property to reorder the frogs according to their lilypads.*/
#pond {
  display: flex;

.yellow {
  order: 3
}

/* Ex. 15 - Use the order property to send the red frog to his lilypad.*/
#pond {
  display: flex;
}

.red {
  order: -1;
