/* Ex. 11 - To vertically position individual towers, use align-self, which accepts the same values as align-items.
Use justify-content and align-self to move your towers into position.

justify-content
flex-start: group items at the start of a container's main axis
flex-end: group items at the end of the main axis
center: group items in the center of the main axis
space-between: evenly distribute items along the main axis such that the first item aligns at the start and the final item aligns at the end
space-around: evenly distribute items along the main axis such that all items have equal space around them

align-self
flex-start: align item at the start of a container's cross axis
flex-end: align item at the end of the cross axis
center: align item at the center of the cross axis
Reminder: align-self, like align-items, also accepts the values baseline and stretch, but these values cannot be used in Flexbox Defense.*/
