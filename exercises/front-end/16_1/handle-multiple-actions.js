// Note: At this point, don't worry about state immutability, since it is small and simple in this example. For each action, you can return a new object â€” for example, {authenticated: true}. Also, don't forget to write a default case in your switch statement that returns the current state. This is important because once your app has multiple reducers, they are all run any time an action dispatch is made, even when the action isn't related to that reducer. In such a case, you want to make sure that you return the current state.

const defaultState = {
  authenticated: false
};

const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'LOGIN':
      return {
        authenticated: true
      }
    case 'LOGOUT':
      return {
        authenticated: false
      }
    default:
      return state
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

const loginUser = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};

const logoutUser = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGOUT'
  }
};
